CMake Warning (dev) at E:/Development/Eclipse/CLion 2021.3.4/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/Compiler/ARMClang.cmake:91 (message):
  Policy CMP0123 is not set: ARMClang cpu/arch compile and link flags must be
  set explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0123" for policy details.  Use
  the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For compatibility, CMake will automatically add cpu/arch flags based on the
  CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR and/or CMAKE_SYSTEM_ARCH variables.
